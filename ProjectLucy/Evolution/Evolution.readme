Evolution

This code implements the evolution/genetic algorithms used to train the neural
networks implemented in ../NeuralNetworks. It interfaces with the set_weights()
and get_weights()functions, and manages a system of files that store the weight
vectors. It manages a setof concurrent networks with different weights, and
handles the merging/breeding/mutation of weights to produce new networks. It
provides an interface to the user to specify the goals of training, so the
algorithm can score the networks and proceed.
